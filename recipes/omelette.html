  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Super easy to make and so good! This omelette has been my daily go to.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>2 to 3 large eggs</li>
    <li>15g unsalted butter</li>
    <li>15ml water or whole milk (optional, for extra fluff)</li>
    <li>1 pinch fine sea salt</li>
    <li>1 pinch black pepper</li>
    <li>30g grated cheese or fresh herbs (optional)</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Steps</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Whisk the eggs, salt, pepper, and water/milk in a bowl until no streaks of white remain.</li>
    <li>Melt the butter in a small non-stick frying pan over medium-low heat until it foams.</li>
    <li>Pour in the egg mixture and let it sit for a few seconds to set at the edges.</li>
    <li>Gently push the cooked edges toward the center with a spatula, tilting the pan to let raw egg fill the gaps.
    </li>
    <li>When the top looks slightly wet but mostly set, sprinkle your cheese or herbs over one half.</li>
    <li>Fold the omelette in half and slide it onto a plate.</li>
    <li>Serve immediately while warm and tender.</li>
  </ol>
